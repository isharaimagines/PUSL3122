## Scenario Analysis - Understanding the Furniture Design Company's Needs and User Context

<p>Product vision of a furniture designing company seeking to develop a desktop application for their customers. This application aims to enable customers to visualize furniture they are interested in purchasing within the context of their own rooms, considering factors such as size, color schemes, and room shapes. A key feature is the ability to check if the selected furniture fits appropriately within the specified room dimensions. The furniture sold by the company includes items such as chairs and various types of tables. The intended users of this application, as specified in the product vision, are the designers working in the store who will use it to demonstrate the final expected look of room designs to visiting customers. Designers will be required to log into their accounts to access the application's functionalities. The core design concept involves the user putting together 2D shapes representing furniture within a room layout and then being able to view this arrangement in a 3D format.

The functional requirements for the admin side of the application, which will be used by the designers, are explicitly listed. These include the ability for designers to provide the size, shape, and color scheme for a room; to create a new design based on these room parameters; to visualize the design in both 2D and 3D formats; to scale the design to optimally fit the room; to add shade to the entire design or selected parts; to change the color of the design as a whole or specific elements; and to save, edit, and delete designs. This scenario clearly establishes a dual user base for the application: the customers who will benefit from the visualization capabilities, and the designers who will use the application as a tool to assist customers in the furniture selection and design process. The in-store context of use by designers with customers present underscores the importance of an intuitive and efficient user interface that allows for quick demonstration and easy manipulation of furniture designs.
